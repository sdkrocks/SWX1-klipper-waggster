Klipper config files for a Sidewinder X1 running the Waggster BLTouch mod

## Printer Mods / Changes

- BLTouch by Waggster -> https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3716043
- Removed Z-axis sync belt (Z-TILT is used to keep them synced)
- Filament runout sensor connected to X+

Fluidd is used for the UI interface

Kiauth is used for software managment/installation -> https://github.com/th33xitus/KIAUH

## Notes

You may need a cura plugin called "Mesh Print Size"
It is used to tell klipper how big the base of the print is and probe the bed in that area.
